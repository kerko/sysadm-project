This class installs firefox.

This is a very simple module which adds a source for debian and ubuntu and installs firefox. This can also will optionally remove icweasel

Examples:

	firefox{"installfirefox":}
	
	

This module has been tested in debian squeeze. It may require modifications and testing to work in other flavors of linux -- the code contains placeholders for where these changes would need to be made. If you would like to contribute the code to enable these other flavors please let us know.
